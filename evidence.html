        <div class="paragraph"><p> Having Phones in the classroom can have many negative effects upon students and their learning.
            For example, students can get notifications in class and that would distract them for a significant amount of time.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is how people like us behave, if you hear a notification on your phone, you would automatically want to check it because maybe it's important.
            This causes anxiety when they dont check their phones and it is not good for both themseleves and their learning.

        <div class="paragraph_2"> Another effect phones can have on students is that they would it would take off time in classes. 
            Teachers would constantly have to keep repeating on what they have to say if the students are constantly checking their phones.
            Thus turning a 20 minute class into a 40 minute class.
            And phones can also make people forget about what they have learnt in class, thus lowering grades down.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is something that needs to be changed because schools are a place to learn, not to be on your phone and lose out on work or study.</div>
