            Hello, My name is Vinz Abulencia, I am 18 years old and a year 13 in my final year of High School. I currently attend South Auckland Seventh Day Adventist School in Auckland,  New Zealand.
            Im planning to go to university called AUT. I dont have any hobbies, because I am lazy to do anything, but
            I spend my time reading Mangas and Manwhas and I like watching youtube videos with memes.
            I live with my family and have no pets (yet) but I looking foward to what the future awaits for me after 2024 ends.
            <br>
            <br>
             I made this website mainly because I need my credits to get my university entrance to go into AUT and get a Job and get alot of money and a stable life and necessities to live
             in this cold and heartless world cuz im lazy and dont like working unless I know what I am doing. If you think I am a reliable source to use if you somehow view this webiste
             then you can have your own opinions about it, as you may probably think that according to ncea standards, this webiste would probably be
             around a 'achieve' grade. (My opinion though)
             <br>
             <br>
            I obviously made this webiste in a rush (plus exams coming up soon, they be acting like we dont have other classes to work on)
             and this webiste is very much disappointing to many people including myself.
             So please give me some mercy to whoever is
            marking/moderating my work, please I want to go to university and have leave this school. Thank you very much for viewing my webiste and have a wonderful day.
            <br>
