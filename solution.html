        <div class="paragraph"><p> A possible solution that I would give is an effort that requires both teachers and students cooperation.
            Students should phone away their phones in bags with notifications turned off, and the screen covered. 
            Or alternatively, face down on their desks (notifications sounds turned off of course). 
            <br>
            <br>
            And teachers should allows break intervals
            every 20 
            minutes in classes, these breaks should last only 5-10 minutes long for students to have a break and allow them to use their phones 
            every once in a while. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is my opinion though, it may not be effective or realistic, but it is the best solution that I could come up with
            that considers and benefits all parties involved reagrding phones and their distractions in schools.

        <div class="paragraph_2"><p>Another solution I would suggest is to simply have your phone in your pocket and have it on 'do not disturb', keeping your phone in your pocket 
            can really make sure that you have your phone at all times even when studying and having to only take it out when you need to do important tasks such as upadating parents and 
            research purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many people would not have self-control and do other things on their phone 
            and I understand that, that is why I would rather say to give the phone to the teacher or trusted friend they would give your phones at the end of the class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            People would of course hate this solution as they wont trust having another person with their phone and would cause anxiety to them, but if you are really 
            desperate to get work done and you know you dont have much self-control with your phone, this is simply a possible solution or rather a plan B if necessary.
