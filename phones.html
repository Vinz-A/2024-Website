<p> Hello, Welcome to my webiste. As you can see by the Title, In this webiste. I will show you 'The distractions of phones in New Zealand schools' (particularly secondary schools).
    <br>
    <br>
    As you know, in the modern era, phones are used in our lives and we use it for a large amount of time for hours everyday. 
    But people dont know when to use it when it is appropriate.
    And in schools, phones ends up affecting the time that could have been used for learning in schools. 
    And it becomes a big problem for teachers and the parents that spend money their child to persue education. 
    As it cost alot of money to attend schools in the first place.
    <br>
    <br>
    This Webiste will show you the evidence that I have gathered from my finding and try to give good explanations regarding my topic as you view my webiste.
    I will also provide a possible solutions to this issue that New Zealand high schools are currently facing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hopefully you can get some good information from my website and I may possibly update the webiste in the future when I get some better education in making a website.
